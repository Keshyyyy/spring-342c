Printing in C++ - std::cout (console out) << input << std::endl (endline)
Boolean == and other operators can be defined in C++ classes to operate differently than their
base versions
Array in c++ is defined statically (for now), to declare a dynamic array put a pointer and allocate
memory for that array
C++ can operate directly with bits as I learned from checking if a number is a power of two, 1000 = power of two
but 0111 is not
& operator vs && operator - && is the boolean and, & returns the memory address of the variable proceeding it, useful
in method headers and inputs
